# kclone-go

Placeholder Go scaffold for a future implementation of the simplified Kubernetes clone.

## Run
- `cd go`
- `go run ./cmd/kclone --version`

## Next steps
- Add core models (Node, Pod, Service, Deployment).
- Implement in-memory state store and scheduler.
- Mirror the Python CLI experience with Cobra or standard library flags.
